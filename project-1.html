        <p class="case-study-text">Bing.com is a search engine with 100 million daily active users, 900 million daily search queries, and $12.2 billion in annual advertising revenue. </p>
        <p class="case-study-text">As of mid 2024, it also had a <span class="highlighted-text">design system that was visually outdated and lacked actual, coded components</span>. That meant that search engine results used across 35+ search engine search segments used custom builds for even basic UI elements like buttons, input fields, and colors.</p>
        <p class="case-study-text">On top of this, the <span class="highlighted-text">latest design system guidance</span>, which was meant to help teams onboard to a modernized visual system, was <span class="highlighted-text">confusing and outdated</span>. </p>
        <p class="case-study-text">Lastly, while there was a medium-term goal of onboarding all search engine answers to the latest visual system, Bing, as part of Microsoft AI, needed to <span class="highlighted-text">eventually align with a newer Microsoft AI design system</span> that is used for a host of products under Microsoft AI, like Copilot. </p>
        <p class="case-study-text">Like many other products with cross-product dependencies and a need to maintain its revenue, Bing and its design system was a complex project with many moving parts.</p>
